# Diagram it.

[Diagram it.](https://marcosvst.github.io/diagramit/) provides a way for you to generate visual diagrams from textual descriptions sourced in public files. It was built upon [Kroki](https://kroki.io/) which is a unified API that actually converts the descriptions into images.

By generating the diagrams using Diagram it., besides never loosing the source, you'll be able to embed them to Notion pages.

## How to use

You can easily generate a link with the diagram by following the steps below:

1. Get a public link for your PlantUML diagram source code (github/gitlab file URL, Google Drive file URL, or raw text)
2. go to Diagram it. homepage, paste the link, and generate the diagram

If your goal is to embed it to Notion pages:

3. Go to any Notion page, paste the link in it, and choose the embed option

| Google Drive files are auto identified by Notion, so just pasting wouldn't work. To work around that, add a new embed block to the Notion page and paste the URL in it.
