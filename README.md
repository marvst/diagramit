# Diagram it.

[Diagram it.](https://marcosvst.github.io/diagramit/) provides a way for you to generate visual diagrams from textual descriptions sourced in public files. It was built upon [Kroki](https://kroki.io/) which is a unified API that actually converts the descriptions into images.

## How to use

You can easily generate a link with the diagram by following the steps below:

1. Get a public link for your PlantUML diagram source code (Github/Gitlab file URL, Google Drive file URL, or raw text)
2. go to Diagram it. homepage, paste the link, and generate the diagram
